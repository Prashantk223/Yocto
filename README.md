Yocto-based embedded Linux environment, creating a custom distribution with new layers, recipes, and system components.
Integrating kernel device drivers and user-space applications through Yocto build and packaging workflows.

• Set up a Yocto/OpenEmbedded build environment and created a custom distribution tailored to target hardware requirements.
• Developed a new Yocto layer and authored BitBake recipes for kernel device drivers and user-space application modules.
• Integrated and built custom kernel modules via Yocto, ensuring proper dependency handling and versioning.
• Customized image recipes to include platform-specific drivers, applications, and configurations.
• Validated builds through cross-compilation and deployment on target, verifying functionality and system integration.
• Gained hands-on experience with Yocto workflows, layer priorities, recipe overrides, and build optimization.
